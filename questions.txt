1.stdint.h is a header file that defines exact width integer types.
2.Here we use intend to use the data in a specific way. uint8_t is an integer that is 8 bits wide.
3.BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes and WORD is 2 bytes.
4.The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and denote bfType which specifies the file type. It must be set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.
5.bfSize specifies the size in bytes,of the bitmap file and biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
6.If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap)and its origin is the upper left corner.
7.The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
8.fopen will return NULL if it cannot create the outfile to write to.
9.It is because the program is reading in 1 RGB at a time.
10.biWidth is the width of the bitmap in pixels. If the width is 3, padding is necessary since the scanline must be a multiple of 4. 3 pixels * 3 bytes per pixel = 9 bytes. Therefore 3 bytes should be added to bring the scanline to 12 bytes.
11.It skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple)
12.It is an integer constant which when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function. It specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
